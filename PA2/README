Programming Assignment 2

Files:
dfc.c client
dfs.c server
dfc1.conf - for testing multiple connnections
dfc.conf
dfs.conf
some example files

To compile:
dfs: gcc dfs.c -o dfs 
dfc: gcc -lssl -lcrypto -o dfc dfc.c

To use run make file
./dfc conf file with username and password in correct format and port info
./dfs DFS1/ PORTNO - run with the correct port numbers matching client conf


NOTE:
For the commands if you want the command to be executed on the server 
side in the top level directory you must accompany the command with 
the '/' character.  (i.e. list all files in top level directory, LIST /).

I have almsot no error handling.  Many crashes may happen if the command 
enter is bad.  Some examples which cause crashes (invalid commands, 
trying to put a file in a directory that doesn't exist on either the 
client or server side (the directories must already exist on the server 
and client side),invalid arguments in the commands)

I also could have taken some of the methods that are common across both the
server and the client and put them in a shared file instead of copy 
pasting similar code.

I make a new directory for each individual user by appending the 
usernumber to the unique user/password id.  This prevents users with 
the same username from accessing eachother's files.
