Programming Assignment 1

Files:
ws.conf
HelloServer.c
MakeFile
Directory with example website

To use my webserver simply run make in the top level directory to build the executable, HelloServer

To run HelloServer type
./HelloServer on the command line

The default port in my ws.conf file is 10001

The directory contains the example webpage which contains text, an embedded image, and hyperlinks. It supports files types, html, htm, png, gif, txt, and jpg.  The assignment required all of these files except jpg, but I added some limited support for it for testing purposes.

For invalid URI, I was unable to find good documentation for what a valid URI was for HTTP protocol.  Thus I made up my own, which says invalid URIs either don’t begin with a ‘/‘ or are more than 255 characters (arbitrary I know).

My error 501: Not Implemented seems to be implemented correctly, but I am getting junk at the beginning of the message. This happens in Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.

For other errors, Safari sometimes displays junk before them.  

I am not sure why this is happening and why it doesn’t happen on all errors and happens on Safair but not Firefox or Chrome.  My only idea about while it’s occurring on Safari is that Safari sends strange requests sometimes for weird files.

For error 500, I did not know what would cause this, so I throw it if my select statement fails or if no index file exists.
